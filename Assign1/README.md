## [1] Compares The Local Repo With The Remote Repo
This informs you if you're local repo is up to date with the remote repo. The local repo being the one on your machine, and the remote repo is the one on Github. This command should be the first thing you run when working with repositories and Git in general. Also, it asks if you want to update your local repo by downloading the remote repo.

## [2] Puts All Uncommited Changes In A File Called "changes.log"
This Puts all uncommited changes in a file called "changes.log". This is great for seeing and tracking all the changes and modifications you've made to your files.

## [3] Extracts The #TODO Text From Projects & Puts It In "todo.log"
This extracts the word "#TODO" from the entire directory and puts it in a file called "todo.log". However, it doesn't look at every single file, as some files have been purposefully ommitted. It also asks if you wanna see the contents of the file.

## [4] Checks All Haskell Files For Syntax Errors & Puts It In "error.log"
This checks all Haskell files in all directories and outputs any errors into a file called "error.log". This is quite useful when you have a ton of Haskell files and you wanna see if they compile without errors. I'm willing to bet Curtis uses this a lot. Also, it asks if you wanna see the contents of the file.

## [5] Creates A TimeStamp For Submission Purposes
This creates a TimeStamp by putting today's date in a textfile. I got this idea from Jupyter Hub. Everytime I open up a marked lab, there's a file called Timestamp and inside it is the day and some other information. I thought it was cool so I added it here. It also asks if you wanna see the contents of the file; even though it's kind of useless to do so.

## [6] Tells You Information About You, Date, & Location
This outputs information such as your name, today's date, and where you are located in a "cute" manner. I got this idea from some random guy on the internet, a couple years ago. His 'siggy' on a forum had a dynamic picture of a bunny holding up a sign saying stuff like: "Your browser is Chrome. You're using Windows. You're living in Canada. I know all about you." Also, I got the bunny from here: https://github.com/neoneggplant/EggShell.

## [7] Turns Off OR Restarts Your Machine
This is quite self explanatory. By tapping a couple of keys, you can restart or shutdown your machine. But, you need to be running as root or provide the password. 

## [8] Exits The Script [If Your Name Is Curtis, Run This!]
This feature was added for the lulz and the bantz. Please don't take it personally. If your name is Curtis, be sure to try this out ;)
