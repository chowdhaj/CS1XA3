## [1] Compares The Local Repo With The Remote Repo

## [2] Puts All Uncommited Changes In A File Called "changes.log"

## [3] Extracts The #TODO Text From Projects & Puts It In "todo.log"

## [4] Checks All Haskell Files For Syntax Errors & Puts It In "error.log"

## [5] Creates A TimeStamp For Submission Purposes
This creates a TimeStamp 

## [6] Tells You Information About You, Date, & Location
This outputs information such as your name, today's date, and where you are located in a "cute" manner. I got this idea from browsing questionable sites on the internet.

## [7] Turns Off OR Restarts Your Machine
This is quite self explanatory. By tapping a couple of keys, you can restart or shutdown your machine. But, you need to be running as root or provide the password

## [8] Exits The Script [If Your Name Is Curtis, Run This!]
This feature was added for the lulz and the bantz. Please don't take it personally. If your name is Curtis, be sure to try this out ;)
